//Project Analysis: Hypermedia Project Part 1//

·Target user profile

The genre of this application is of E-commerce, since the goal of the website is to offer
services to the user. By showing the skills and providing evidemce of previous work,
the trust of the user can be won easier.

Because of the nature of the site, its size will be fairly limited to keep as much anonymity
as possible.

The user is assumed to be of age and with a considerable amount of economy. The user will
be kept privated and anonymous, with no trace of any transaction ever happening within
the data base. It is also assumed that the user already knows what they're in for, and
the website will only facilitate the specific needs that the user has without guidance.

·Infromation Architecture

As seen on the Figma, the user will need to login permanently to the website, only being
able to do it once per IP adress. After that, the main menu appears where the user
can start to navigate through the website. Here, they can ask for jobs, in which case the
website will show the most capable and reputated employees that can be contacted, or they
can directly contact the main contractors of the site or previous employees.

Once the user is in an employee profile, they will see the curriculum vitae of that specific
person, where they can contact and contract them for any job they specialize in, same with
the contractors. However, once the contract is signed, there will be no turning back on
that decision, locking them in. Once the job is completed and verified, the user will be
freed from this lock. Other than that, the user will be able to go back and forth within
the pages of the website.

·Visual Design

To make it a little more interesting, I had the idea of making a criminal variant of a
Curriculum Vitae and give it a Deep Web-ish look. For it, I could use inverted colors from
usual normal pages, with white text over a black screen, with a visual design and layout that
inspires a threatening, uncomfortable yet professional aura, that forces the employer to
commit to the decision of hiring the person behind the CV.
